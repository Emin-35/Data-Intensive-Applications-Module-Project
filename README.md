Time Series Classification Problem for Data-Intensive Applications

This project focuses on a time series classification problem within the context of data-intensive applications. The goal is to develop a robust model that can analyze sequential data and accurately classify patterns over time. By leveraging machine learning techniques and feature extraction methods, the project aims to identify meaningful trends, anomalies, or categories in time-dependent datasets.

The dataset consists of historical financial stock data, including open prices, sector information, and ticker symbols, spanning multiple time periods. Advanced time series feature extraction techniques, such as those provided by tsfresh, will be employed to derive relevant statistical and temporal characteristics from the data.

Key objectives of this project include:

- Preprocessing and structuring the time series data for analysis.
- Extracting meaningful features using domain-specific methods.
- Implementing classification models to predict categories based on temporal patterns.
- Optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.
  
This project is crucial for applications in finance, predictive maintenance, and anomaly detection, where accurate classification of time-dependent data is essential.
